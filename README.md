<h1 align="center"> E-Commerce Back End </h1>



## Description

I want to develop a back end for my e-commerce website.  To do that, this app will configure a working Express.js API to use and Object Relational Mapping package  called Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database so that you can view, add, edit, and delete data.

## Installation
This application will require you to use Node.js, Express.js, and the Sequelize ORM to connect to the database and interact with it. First to connect to the database, you need to login to your MySQL by running `mysql -u root -p` on the command while in the is app's directory and enter your password which should be entered in the .env file.  Once you are in MySQL, you will have to run the schema with `source db/schema.sql` on the command line.  Then you can use the script `npm run seed` to seed the database. Finally, connect to the server by running `npm run start`.
